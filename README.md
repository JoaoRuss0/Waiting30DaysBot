# WaitingBot

## Description

This bot's purpose is solely to update me every 6 hours on my main Discord server and 2 other with how much time elapsed since I made my monitor RMA. Since the limit for the RMA is 30 days, hence the name of the bot.

## Setup

```bash
# install dependencies
$ npm install

# run
$ node index.js
```

## Conclusion

Bot ran for 9 days, got an email stating the monitor was ready to be picked up, picked it up, 4 hours in and it looks as good as new :)
